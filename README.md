# Calgary-Crime-Data-Analysis-and-Neural-Network-Prediction
The aim of this project is to use the Crime and Disorder Data provided by the City of Calgary's data website to analyze the data and predict the number of crimes that will occur in the future. The data is from 2018 to 2024 and contains the number of crimes that occurred in Calgary for each month.
